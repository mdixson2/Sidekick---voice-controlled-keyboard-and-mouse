# User Guide

Sidekick takes voice commands and converts them to actions on the computer. It operates differently when in different states or modes. There are currently three modes, described below, but more can be added.

- command - this mode allows the user to issue a variety of commands
- mouse - this mode allows the user to control the mouse
- text - this mode transcribes spoken speech to text

In each mode certain keywords are linked to certain actions. To switch between modes, simply say 'command', 'mouse', or 'text'. These keywords are reserved to switch between modes. 

## Command

Some commands are stateless, in that they function no matter what state/mode you are in. Others only function when in the command state.

#### Stateless

- `click` or `go` - double click left mouse button
- `double` - double click left mouse button
- `enter` 
- `space`
- `back [1-7]` - hit backspace 

#### Stateful

- `up`, `left`, `down`, `right` - arrow keys
- `copy`
- `paste`
- `save`
- `north [1-7]`, `south [1-7]`, `east [1-7]`, `west [1-7]` - move mouse in cardinal directions 
- `scroll [up,down,left,right] [1-7]`
